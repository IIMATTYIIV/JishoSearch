Jisho Search

------------

This script allows for the scraping of dictionary entries (kanji, hiragana / katakana readings, definitions, part(s) of speech) of a given JLPT (Japanese Language Proficiency Test) level from jisho.org. The script outputs both to the console and an excel file according to the specified JLPT level.

The following libraries were used: BeautifulSoup (from bs4), requests, xlwt, and lxml.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions. Thank you for reading !
