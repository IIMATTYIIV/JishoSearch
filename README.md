# Jisho Search

This script allows for the scraping of dictionary entries of a given JLPT (Japanese Language Proficiency Test) level from jisho.org. The specific data scraped includes kanji, furigana, meaning, part of speech, and commonality. The script outputs both to the console and an excel file according to the specified JLPT level.

## Libraries 

You will need to install the following libraries to succesfully run the script.

## Acknowledgements

- This was my first script to utilize web scraping.
- Extracting dictionary entries of Japanese words (specifically according to JLPT level) into a spreadsheet is quite useful.
- [Jisho.org](https://jisho.org/) is a fantastic resource that has been considerably helpful prior to writing this script - would recommend to anyone interested in or currently learning Japanese.
