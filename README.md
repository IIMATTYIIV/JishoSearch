Jisho Search


This program allows a user to scrape jisho.org for the purposing of documenting words (both kanji and hiragana readings) and definitions of a given JLPT (Japanese Language Proficiency Test) level such as N5 through N1.

The code is written in Python and uses the BeautifulSoup4 library.
